# RAG_Pdf_chat
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that enables chatting with PDF documents.
It extracts text from PDFs, creates embeddings, stores them in a vector database, retrieves the most relevant chunks for a user query, reranks them for semantic relevance, and finally generates a natural language answer using Gemini 2.5 Flash.
